> Compating Identity Politics, One Swipe At A Time.

## Getting started
Welcome to Voder, an online platform of presendential information to help voters across America make an informed decision during the 2020 election!

## The Code
The code we used is centered around the `SlideableCards.veu` file. The software that we used was Vue.js and Yarn, both of which helped greatly in the development of our Javascript project. We also downloaded 'npm install --save sweetalert' to allow us to present aesthetic alert boxes for our users after every 10 cards.

The goal of Voder is to act as a source of information in an interactive way. We use a deck of 60 cards, wherein the user can decide to either accept, skip, or reject that card. Each card is based on a certain topic (10 categories in total), and there are 6 cards per category. These cards describe the stances of the presendential candidates (Trump and Biden), and the user can decide whether or not he/she agrees, disagrees, or feels indifferent about the candidate's stance.

The cards were developed via Figma, and uploaded to our files in the `...assets/images' file.
